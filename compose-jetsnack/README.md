## Kotlin/Wasm

> **Note**
> Kotlin/Wasm is Experimental and may be changed at any time. Use it only for evaluation purposes.
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in the public Slack channel [#webassembly](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/webassembly).
> If you face any issues, please report them on [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-56492).

Kotlin/Wasm is a new experimental target that enables developers to compile Kotlin code to WebAssembly (Wasm).

By compiling Kotlin code to WebAssembly, you can run it on any WebAssembly-compatible environment that meets Kotlin's requirements, including web browsers.
This creates numerous opportunities, such as developing high-performance web applications and serverless functions.

## Compose Multiplatform for Web

> **Note**
> Web support is Experimental and may be changed at any time. Use it only for evaluation purposes.
> We would appreciate your feedback on it in the public Slack channel [#compose-web](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/compose-web).
> If you face any issues, please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/issues).

Compose for Web is based on [Kotlin/Wasm](https://kotl.in/wasm), the newest target for Kotlin Multiplatform projects.
It allows you to run your code in the browser with all the benefits that WebAssembly has to offer, such as good and predictable performance for your applications.

## Setup environment

### IDE

We recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA 2023.1 or later](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to work with the project.
It has Kotlin/Wasm support out of the box.

### Browser (for Kotlin/Wasm target)

Almost all modern browsers already support WebAssembly 1.0.

To run applications built with Kotlin/Wasm in a browser, you need to enable an experimental [garbage collection feature](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc):

**Chrome**:

For version 109:

  1. Run the application with the `--js-flags=--experimental-wasm-gc` command line argument.

For version 110 or later:

  1. Go to `chrome://flags/#enable-webassembly-garbage-collection` in your browser.
  2. Enable **WebAssembly Garbage Collection**.
  3. Relaunch your browser.

**Firefox Nightly**:

For version 112 or later:

1. Go to `about:config` in your browser.
2. Enable `javascript.options.wasm_function_references` and `javascript.options.wasm_gc` options.
3. Relaunch your browser.

**Edge**:

For version 109 or later:

1. Run the application with the `--js-flags=--experimental-wasm-gc` command line argument.
